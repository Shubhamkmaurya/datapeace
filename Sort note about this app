This app is working properly.
On first page you can find user from his first_name and last_name.
On same page every data is paginated (showPerPage = 10 users).
On clicking First name you redirect to another page and here you can see user's all the details.
On user detail page clicking left arrow icon you can redirect on same user data page .
In user's detail heading added one ascending and descending icon so you can arrenge data according to that icon .
